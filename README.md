- 👋 Hi, I’m @MikeJenkins-iz
- 👀 I’m interested in continuous improvement.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can about iSeatz!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything!  But first, iSeatz Slack reactions
- 📫 How to reach me
   - First, `@Jenkins` on Slack is best.
   - Second, probably email at Michael.Jenkins@iseatz.com.
   - You could always try a carrier pidgeon.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have [Aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia).  I do not have the ability to "close my eyes and picture an anything.  My ability to recall things visually is based on memory and event memory, but I cannot "see it".
